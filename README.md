This is the last project for the Introductin to Cloud Computing course! It is a weather app that allows users to search through and upload weather data for analysis, as well as receive predictions for how to prepare for tomorrow's weather based on their preferences.

For the instructor: The docx file has the writeup and screenshots (also stored in the images folder), and the csv file has data to upload to see how it changes predictions.
